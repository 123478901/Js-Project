<!--notes img src="".your home page has to be index.html, if it was something else you would write it like about page and so on.you can open your web browser on say chrome and so on, and you refresh everytime, so that is why live server was downloaded, chech what live server's do.head element has the meta data(figure out what is meta data) links to maybe your css page and so on and also the title these things won't show up in your page.127 is the url for live server. html is whitespace collapsing so any space you skip in your code html would ignore and process your code as if there was no spacing.check dummy text like lorem and also continue arond 49 mins( My edit on github has been checked)-->
